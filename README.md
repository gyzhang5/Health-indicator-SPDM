# Health-indicator-SPDM
A new health indicator provided for the comparison of machinery condition monitoring.

Health indicator (HI), which aims to make quantitative measures for machinery operating state at different degradation stages, is very critical in machinery condition monitoring. Here, we provide a new HI, which was constructed based on the signal probability distribution measures, for the performance comparison of different methods.
